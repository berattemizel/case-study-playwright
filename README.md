# SymphonySolutions Project

## Instructions

### 1. Use appropriate test runner and test reporting tool.
We are using Playwright as the test runner and `expect` for assertions.

### 2. Implement assertions to verify the expected behavior.
Assertions are implemented using `expect` in the test files.

### 3. Use relevant build tool for the project.
The project uses npm for managing dependencies and running scripts.

### 4. Provide clear instructions in the Readme file on how to run the automated tests locally and on CI.
